## Description

The Virtual Alcohol Gallery is an interactive program that allows you to walk through a gallery showcasing various types of alcoholic beverages.  
The user can:

- Freely explore the gallery from a first-person perspective
- View a variety of alcohol bottles
- Select any bottle and "take a drink" from it

**Special Effect:**  
With each subsequent "drink" from a chosen bottle, the view becomes more distorted ‚Äì simulating the typical perceptual disturbances experienced after alcohol consumption.
